# maas-lxd
This is a simple project to provide MAAS with KVM POD capability in a LXD container.

## Getting Started
- LXD must be installed and working. [LXD Install Guide](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/)

## Running
Run the make-maas.sh and name your MAAS container.
```
./make-maas.sh maas
```
This applies the included profile to a container, tries to get it's IP address
and adds a dnsmasq entry to LXD so that containers which PXE will be sent to
MAAS. Note that DNS/DHCP is still done via LXD. If you are using the default NAT
configuration you'll be able to spin up KVM's inside this LXD container through
MAAS. If you're using a bridged network setup you'll need to handle network
configuration to address how you want DHCP/DNS/PXE to be routed.

The install can take some time as it has to install several packages. When it is
complete you can access your MAAS node at http://MAASIP/MAAS

## Using MAAS
See the [MAAS Documentation](https://docs.ubuntu.com/maas/devel/en/) for up to
date information. A few quick comments
- An admin user has been setup, password/login are admin/admin
- You can use MAAS PODS, but that is not automatically added currently with this
  script. To do so:
  - Go to the PODS page in MAAS
  - Select "Add pod"
  - Select Virsh (virtual system) as the Pod type
  - For Virsh address use "qemu:///system"
  - Optionally name your pod

Once PODs are configured you can create them directly from the MAAS interface.
MAAS will also compose a pod for juju when juju requests a machine.
Additionally, Juju can bootstrap into a MAAS pod allowing MAAS and the juju
controller to both live inside this LXD on a single machine. Recall that if you
are doing this to manage external hardware you will have to address more
advanced networking than is currently handled here.

For more information on using Juju with MAAS see [Using a MAAS
cloud](https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/clouds-maas) in the juju documentation.
